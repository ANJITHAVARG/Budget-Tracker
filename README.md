Personal Budget Tracker is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that allows users to register, log in, and manage their personal finances. Users can add, edit, and delete income and expense transactions, set monthly budgets, and view their financial summaries through charts. The backend server (Node.js + Express) connects to MongoDB Atlas, handles user authentication with JWT, and provides secure API routes. The frontend (React.js) offers a mobile-responsive UI for easy budget tracking. To run the project locally, set up the backend by creating a .env file with your MongoDB URI and JWT secret, then run npm run dev. For the frontend, navigate to the frontend folder, run npm install, and npm start to launch it on http://localhost:3000. The project is collaboratively developed by the team and is structured for scalability and future feature expansion.
