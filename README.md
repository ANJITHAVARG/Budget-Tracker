## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

The backend uses MongoDB with Mongoose to manage persistent data. The following collections are implemented:

- **User**: Stores account information, including name, email (with format validation and uniqueness), and a securely hashed password using bcrypt.

- **Transaction**: Logs income and expense records linked to users. It includes validation for transaction type (`Income` or `Expense`), category, amount, and date. 

- **Budget**: Tracks budget limits per user and category. Validates categories against a defined list and enforces one budget per category per user via a compound index.

### Additional Features

- **Validation**: Enforced at the schema level for all models (e.g., required fields, format validation, numeric constraints, enums).
  
- **Relationships**: Both transactions and budgets reference the user `_id` using Mongoose `ObjectId` and `ref`.

- **Seeding**: A `seed.js` script is available to insert a sample user, multiple budgets, and transactions for testing purposes.

- **ERD Diagram**: Located in `/Backend/Docs/ERD.jpeg`, visualizing the relationships and schema design.
